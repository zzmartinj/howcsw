howcsw is a fun side project I've been meaning to do for about a year or so and well...
It's a simple API (for now) that will take in a string and search bing (through Azure cognitive services API) for the answer and hopefully return a date. 
That's it! Now it's supposed to tell us how old one of my friends is when a certain event occured. But really I'm just
using it as an exercise to learn how to do node/express development and other things. So it's really just a playground service
